Disclaimer: This file was originally transcribed by hand onto 
paper and then digitized again. It is highly likely that additional 
errors were introduced during these transcription processes due 
to the large volume of text. Nonetheless most of the weird coding 
choices like indentation errors are from the original file.

Since your task is to correct errors in this subject, I believe 
this won't pose a significant issue. The purpose of this piece 
of code is to help you grasp the general concept of the subject 
"Broken GNL." Additionally these subjects are still undergoing 
updates and changes, so prepare for the details to be different.

I did not copy the actual subject. But it did go along the line
